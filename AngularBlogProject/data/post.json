The number of 1000 word essay pages should be one or two A4 sheets, not more, so maybe it is not as much as you think. Producing a written work requires formal preparation, but before you formally prepare, gather your thoughts on the subject and think about what you really know. In order to be successful at writing essays, you need to know enough about the topic and simply present your own thoughts rather than trying to write what they expect you to write. You need to have your own thoughts and your own opinion about the matter, in that case writing should not present such a difficulty. Research the topic using multiple online and library resources, or simply read 1000 word essay example on the Internet, and shape your own opinion. This way, it will be much easier for you to deal with the task."
